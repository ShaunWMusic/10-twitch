FAQ
[ ] test driven development - dedicated lesson this week
[ ] 'debugger'
[ ] JS DOM manipulation
[ ] 'document.createElement(tagName)' - creates a new element floating around in memory (not shown to user yet)
[ ] 'document.querySelector(selector)' - looks for the first instance of an element that matches the selector in th whole page
[ ] 'element.querySelector(selector)' - looks for the first instance of an element that matches the selector within a specific element
  [ ] ex 'track.querySelector('h1')' this selects the first 'h1' element in the 'track' element
[ ] 'element.classList.add(className)'  adds a class to the element based on the passed in string argument
  [ ] ex 'track.classList.add('track-item')'
[ ] 'element.classList.remove(className)' -- removes a class from the element based on the passed in string argument
  [ ] ex. 'track.classList.remove('track-item')'
  [ ] 'element.classList.toggle(className)' - if the calss does not exist on the element add it, if it does, remove it (helpful for
      hiding/showing element like dropdowns or for CSS animations)
  [ ] ex. 'dropdown.classList.toggle('is-open')'
  [ ] ex. 'dropdown.classList.toggle('dropdown--open')'
[ ] 'element.innerText' - sets the contents of the element, escaing all special characters (helpful to protect from scriptting attacks)
[ ]
 'element.innerHTML' - sets the contents of the element and all content will be parsed as HTML. This should only be used for templates, string literals, and TRUSTED information
    (so don't use it with variable data)
    [ ] this is 'x.innerHTML' = someVariables' (what if 'someVariables = '<script type="javascript"> > window.location =
      "http://someothersite.com"</script>' , this would redirect our page based on user input data and allow for security attacks)
